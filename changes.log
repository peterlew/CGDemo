cwd change from Users/plewis to Users/peter
remove CG framework and re-add in correct location
Old profiles: VP40, FP40. Now using CGprofile f_prof = cgGLGetLatestProfile(CG_GL_FRAGMENT);


Implementation notes:

smooth transition between arbitrary fractals is possible by interpolating
between iteration functions. However, this requires a shader with the two
functions hard-coded in as func1 and func2. We could achieve this but 
there is a lot of redundancy involved, and for N fractal functions we'd
need N-choose-2, or N(N-1)/2 shaders. Could be worse, I could see a 
program with 20 fractals and 190 shaders. Remember, each fractal function
supports a LOT of variation. 

This does mean that the shaders should be able to be written procedurally. 
If a few of them need to be tweaked by hand to work, that's fine, but most
should be automatically generated. The shaders should take the form
	p = var1 * func1( args) + (1.0 - var1) * func2( args )
	...
	OUT.color = float4( some mix of col, len, and var2 )
	
The program could actually generate these on the fly. Hmmm...

For next week's demo:
	Let's try to show three or four diff fractals, one morphing 
	into the next. Goal: 4 minute video
	
	Fractals:
		Mandel
		Newton
		Ship
		Nova
		
	Variables:
		Zoom
		Color
		Multiplier
		Rotation
		Location
		
Challenges: 
	Would be really nice to smoothly change iteration count, but the cg 
	compiler has to be able to unroll the 'while'
